# PopMart Inventory Monitor - Advanced E-Commerce Security Research

## Overview
A sophisticated real-time inventory monitoring system for PopMart's e-commerce platform, developed through comprehensive reverse engineering of their web application's security mechanisms and API architecture. This project demonstrates advanced capabilities in web security analysis, API reverse engineering, and automated threat detection methodologies.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Security Features
- **API Signature Reverse Engineering**: Successfully decoded and reimplemented PopMart's proprietary request signing algorithm through dynamic analysis and JavaScript deobfuscation
- **Anti-Bot Bypass Mechanisms**: Engineered sophisticated evasion techniques to circumvent multiple layers of bot detection including:
  - Browser fingerprinting countermeasures
  - TLS/JA3 signature spoofing
  - Request pattern randomization
  - Human-like interaction simulation

### Implementation Highlights

#### 1. Request Authentication System
- Reverse engineered the client-side signature generation process (`signature.js`)
- Implemented cryptographic request signing to authenticate API calls
- Analyzed and replicated the exact request header structure required for successful authentication

#### 2. Distributed Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Proxy Rotation System**: Built a resilient proxy management layer to distribute requests across multiple endpoints
- **Rate Limiting Evasion**: Implemented intelligent request throttling and distribution algorithms
- **Session Management**: Advanced cookie and session token handling to maintain persistent authenticated connections

#### 3. Real-Time Notification Pipeline
- **Discord Webhook Integration**: Instant alert system for inventory changes
- **Custom Embed Formatting**: Rich notification messages with product details, images, and direct purchase links
- **Event Deduplication**: Intelligent filtering to prevent duplicate notifications

### Security Research Methodologies Applied

#### Static Analysis
- JavaScript deobfuscation and beautification
- API endpoint discovery through source code analysis
- Authentication flow reverse engineering

#### Dynamic Analysis
- Network traffic interception and analysis using proxy tools
- Runtime JavaScript debugging to understand signature generation
- API behavior modeling through request/response pattern analysis

#### Evasion Techniques
- User-Agent rotation and browser emulation
- Request timing randomization to mimic human behavior
- Geographic distribution through proxy networks

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.x**: Primary application logic and orchestration
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing reversed signature generation code
- **Requests Library**: HTTP client with advanced session management
- **Threading**: Concurrent monitoring of multiple product SKUs

### Security Tools Utilized
- Network intercepting proxies for traffic analysis
- JavaScript debuggers for runtime analysis
- Custom cryptographic implementations for signature generation

## Key Achievements

1. **100% API Coverage**: Successfully mapped and implemented all required endpoints for inventory monitoring
2. **Zero Detection Rate**: Bypassed all anti-bot measures without triggering security alerts
3. **Sub-Second Response Time**: Optimized monitoring loop achieves near real-time detection of inventory changes
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to monitor unlimited SKUs simultaneously without performance degradation

## Security Implications & Defensive Recommendations

Through this research, several security vulnerabilities were identified in typical e-commerce platforms:

1. **Client-Side Security**: Reliance on client-side signature generation exposes authentication mechanisms
2. **Rate Limiting Gaps**: Insufficient rate limiting on API endpoints allows automated monitoring
3. **Bot Detection Weaknesses**: Current anti-bot solutions can be bypassed with proper request crafting

## Ethical Considerations

This project was developed strictly for educational and research purposes to understand e-commerce security mechanisms. The techniques demonstrated highlight the importance of robust server-side security measures and proper API protection strategies.

## Installation & Configuration

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Resneak/Popmart-monitor.git

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure proxy list (create proxies.txt with your proxy endpoints)
echo "proxy1:port" > proxies.txt

# Run the monitor
python monitor.py
```

## Configuration Parameters
